For this project, my team was tasked with developping a robot to aid people during the COVID-19 pandemic. We decided to create a robot that cleaned surfaces, specifically tables, without the user actually touching the table and possibly getting contaminated.

We used two DC motors and an ultrasonic distance sensor mounted onto a lasercut chassis designed in AutoCAD. This device worked relatively well and can be seen in action in the video listed.
